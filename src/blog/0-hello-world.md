# Hello world

Hello and welcome! I've needed a website for a while to write about my projects and I finally got around to making a ~~good~~ decent website for that. If you want to see how it was made click on the "Source" link in the upper right hand corner. I don't recommend you use that GitHub repo for making your own website; the code is not very good.

Until I add more content you can click on the "About" link and go to my social pages.

Happy coding!
